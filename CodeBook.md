These are the variables used to clean and arrange the data.
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
  - features: reading in the features.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset folder. Added column names "number" and "funcs". 
              561 obs. of 2 variables
  - activities: reading in the activity_labels.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset folder. Added column names "code" and "activity"
              6 obs. of 2 variables
  - subject_test: reading in the subject_tests.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset/test folder. Added column name "subject"
              2947 obs. of 1 variable
  - x_test: reading in the X_test.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset/test folder. Added column name from features$funcs
              2947 obs. of 561 variables
  - y_test: reading in the Y_test.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset/test folder. Added column name from "code"
              2947 obs. of 1 variable
  - subject_train: reading in the subject_train.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset/train folder. Added column name "subject"
              7352 obs. of 1 variable
  - x_train: reading in the X_train.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset/train folder. Added column name from features$funcs
              7352 obs. of 561 variables
  - y_train: reading in the Y_train.txt file in UCI HAR Dataset/train folder. Added column name from "code"
              7352 obs. of 1 variable
  
  
  - x: rbinding x_test and x_train
              10299 obs. of 561 variables
  - y: rbinding y_test and y_train
              10299 obs. of 1 variable
  - subject: rbinding subject_test and subject_train
              10299 obs. of 1 variable
   
   - merged_data: cbinding x, y, and subject
              10299 obs. of 563 variables

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

  - TidyData: taking merged_data and selecting by "mean" and "std"
              10299 obs. of 88 variables
              
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  - TidyData$code. Replaced numbers in this column with activity names from activities dataset above.
  
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

   - TidyData code column renamed to activities
   - Acc to Accelerometer
   - Gyro to Gyroscope
   - BodyBody to Body
   - Mag to Magnitude
   - f to Frequency
   - t to Time
   - tBody to TimeBody
   - -mean() to Mean
   - -std() to STD
   - -freq() to Frequency
   - angle to Angle
   - gravity to Gravity
   
   
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   - second_data summarizes TidyData and exported to final_data.txt
              180 obs. of 88 variables
